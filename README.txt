TEAM: JRP

INTRO:
	For this project, we had to use the cella ant #12 algorithm and create a display 
	using Javascript on an HTML webpage. Cella ant #12 function is determined by the 
	number 1100 inbinary--where 1 means turn left, and 0 means turn right. For visuals, 
	each bit is assigned a color: 0 = black, 1 = red, 2 = yellow, 3 = blue. The algorithm
	is displayed using these colors. The Cella Ant #12 will move 1000 moves before ending, 
	thus letting use see how the algorithm works.
