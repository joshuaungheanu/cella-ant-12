When your project is complete, you should provide a README.txt text file. Be clear in your instruction on how to build and use the project by providing instructions a novice programmer would understand. If there are any external dependencies for building, the README must also list them and how to find and incorporate them. Usage should include an example invocation. A README would cover the following:

• Class number
• Project number and name
• Team name and members
• Intro (including the algorithm used)
• Contents: Files in the .zip submission

Academic Rules

• External Requirements (None?)
• Setup and Installation (if any)
• Sample invocation
• Features (both included and missing) • Bugs (if any)
